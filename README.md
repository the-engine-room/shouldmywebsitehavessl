#[Should my Website Have SSL?](https://the-engine-room.github.io/shouldmywebsitehavessl/)

This is a splash site designed to help people think and learn about the importance of SSL (Secure Sockets Layer, a cryptographic protocol that provides security for communication over the internet) and secure online communication. The site is nowhere near exhaustive: it is meant to highlight the most crucial, and accessible, reasons for implementing and using SSL.

Please feel free to **view the site, to fork it, edit it, improve it and share it widely**. We’d like the site to be as effective and accurate as possible, so please send us pull requests and open issues to address any bugs or resources we missed. Of course, there is a good deal more to say about the topic, but we’re hoping it’s enough to get site managers thinking and asking the right questions.

We think SSL is incredibly important as a first step to making the internet more secure and reliable--just one part of a comprehensive responsible data strategy. This website was made in a sprint at Greenhost as part of the [Responsible Data Forum](https://responsibledata.io/forums/responsible-hosting/). For more on responsible data work with the engine room and partners, please visit [responsibledata.io](https://responsibledata.io).

The website is based on the [windows.js](https://github.com/nick-jonas/nick-jonas.github.com/tree/master/windows) plugin and framework by [Nick Jonas](https://github.com/nick-jonas)
