Our time is valuable so if we spend it, it should also be taken serious. Securing your communications is a token of appreciation to your visitors.

                <div class="explanation">In some situations, merely visiting and reading your site might endanger your visitors. Also if you use a CMS like WordPress you are logging in to your own website through a webform. Not using SSL reveals your login credentials to anyone on the line between you and your website meaning your log-in details can be used to manipulate content on your site.

                	<pre>It is difficult to get.</pre>
Move to a webhoster that will set it up for you. They do it all they time and you just have to ask them.

<pre>It is too expensive.</pre>
There are ways to do this on the cheap, like making your own certificate. But first you have to ask yourself; how serious do you take the integrity of your own site and the security of your visitors?

<pre>I'm a security professional and there is a problem with your explanation.</pre>
Do you disagree with the idea of this site in general, or are you determined to find fault with a specific part of it? 
Ha! But what about Heartbleed what about CA's? They are a horrible mafia!!!!

<pre>My site already has SSL!</pre>
You get a golden star with a rainbow. Now move on to DNSSEC to unlock the unicorn level
